DevOps brings together the best practices for software development and engineering, quality assurance, and IT operations.

MLOps will ensure model governance is established as a key part of the process, and that the model risks are clearly understood. This fits the machine learning model into wider conversations on risk management within the organization. It also frames the model as a tool to achieve wider business objectives. There is a range of MLOps software options available to help track the MLOps process.
